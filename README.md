## Taproot expands Bitcoinâ€™s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy. By combining both MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree) & Schnoor, Taproot is able to mask a complex smart contract as a regular bitcoin transaction. 
More information on how this works can be found in this article by Aaron Van Wirdum [Taproot Is Coming: What It Is, And How It Will Benefit Bitcoin](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin)
 
 In order to activate the Taproot protocol upgrade a consensus must be met by the majority of Bitcoin nodes. A softfork. There are several different activation methods to achieve this upgrade, they are:
  
 BIP 8
 Moden Soft Fork Activation
 Bip 8 + BIP 91
 Sporks
 
 The aim of this site is to assist in the activation of the Taproot soft fork. We have reached out to several Bitcoin mining pools to find out if:
 
1. 1. Would like to activate Taproot
1. 2. Which activation method they prefer
1. 3. What threshold percentage should be met
