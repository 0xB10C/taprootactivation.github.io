**The aim of this site is to assist in the activation of the Taproot soft fork. We have reached out to several Bitcoin mining pools to find out if:**
 
1. Would like to activate Taproot
1. Which activation method they prefer
1. What threshold percentage should be met
 
 Mining Pool |   Taproot?     |  Activation   | Threshold
